# Getting started with SimNIBS

## Background

SimNIBS is a free and open source software package for the Simulation of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation. Besides allowing for calculations of the electric field induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electric stimulation (TES), the methods implemented in SinNIBS can also be used for forward and inverse EEG source modelling.

This page serves as a starting point for more elaborate documentation that we hope to include here soon.
