### 25 June 2025

Robert and Mikkel returned from the [African Brain Data Network](https://africanbraindatanetwork.com/) EEG workshop in Nigeria. It was a nice and intense week with lectures, experimental design, practical experience recording with various EEG systems, and hands-on EEG data analysis sessions. The interaction with the participants was great, and we look forward to see the research that will result from this. All course material, including slides and video recordings of the lectures are shared on the [workshop page](/workshop/nigeria2025/).
