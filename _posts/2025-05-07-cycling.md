### 7 May 2025

Together with the developers of other MEG and EEG analysis software (a.o. MNE-Python, SPM, EEGLAB) we wrote the paper [Cycling on the Freeway: The perilous state of open-source neuroscience software](https://doi.org/10.1162/imag_a_00554) in which we argue that the existing ecosystem of neuroscientific open-source software is brittle, and discuss why and how the neuroscience community needs to come together to ensure a healthy software ecosystem to the benefit of all. Please have a look and think about how you can contribute to the long-term continuation of projects like FieldTrip.
