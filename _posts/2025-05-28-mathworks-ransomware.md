### 28 May 2025

During the [MEG/EEG toolkit last week](/workshop/toolkit2025) we noticed that some participants had issues with their MathWorks accounts to download and install the latest MATLAB version. We have now heard that MathWorks has been affected by a [ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mathworks-blames-ransomware-attack-for-ongoing-outages/amp/). Although our (and hopefully your) local MATLAB installations continue working just fine, it inconvenient as we are busy with preparing for the [EEG workshop in Nigeria](/workshop/nigeria2025). For that workshop we want to use MATLAB online, i.e., running it all in the cloud, which would be the first time doing it like this. Let's hope that MathWorks does not suffer too much and that they can get their systems up and running again.
