### 25 March 2025

We have added three example scripts to the website that demonstrate how to compute EEG forward solutions. They show the similarities and differences between an analytic concentric spheres solution, a BEM solution, and a FEM solution. Furthermore, they show how to deal with geometrical units (millimeter, centimeter, meter) to get correct SI units in the forward and inverse solution.

- [Compute EEG leadfields using a concentric spheres headmodel](/example/source/concentricspheres/)
- [Compute EEG leadfields using a BEM headmodel](/example/source/bem/)
- [Compute EEG leadfields using a FEM headmodel](/example/source/fem/)

If you have feedback on these examples, please post an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/website/issues).

Note that there are also more elaborate tutorials using [BEM](/tutorial/source/headmodel_eeg_bem) and [FEM](/tutorial/source/headmodel_eeg_fem) for source reconstruction of EEG data.
