### 10 October 2025
Robert and JM participated in a very inspiring and successful workshop in Marseille, celebrating the opening of the Marseille OPM lab, and the retirement of their 4D Neuroimaging SQUID system. Two days filled with the latest news from OPM-land, with inspiring and constructive discussions, and a collaborative mindset. Thanks and congratulations to our friends in Marseille, and good luck with your great scientific and clinical contributions to the field.
