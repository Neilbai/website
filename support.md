# Support

{% include markup/yellow %}

If you have **questions about the use** of FieldTrip, please ask them on the [email discussion list](/discussion_list). The developers in general do not have time to address individual's questions. The community at large includes a much broader pool of expertise w.r.t. neuroscientific topics, experimental designs, specific data acquisition systems, and analysis strategies. Also, by sharing the questions and answers on a public forum, many more people benefit.

If you get a MATLAB error when using FieldTrip and you suspect that it is not due to you specifying the incorrect options to the function, but that it is due to a **problem in the implementation** of the software, please report it as an [issue](/development/issues) on GitHub.

For questions that are **not suitable** for the public email list or as GitHub issue, e.g., discussing potential contributions to the toolbox or requests for organizing a local workshop, you can send an email to Robert Oostenveld (robert.oostenveld at donders.ru.nl) or Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen (janmathijs.schoffelen at donders.ru.nl).

If needed, you can also contact us via regular mail:
