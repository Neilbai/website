# Why am I not receiving emails from the discussion list?

Your registration may have been automatically disabled because

- your mailbox is full, no more messages can be sent to you.
- your e-mails are sent to an old address that no longer exists

Both problems will cause emails sent to you to bounce back. After some time (i.e. after a number of bounces) your email address will be automatically removed from the list. See also the FAQ on [warnings about too many bouncing emails](/faq/why_am_i_receiving_warnings_about_too_many_bouncing_emails).

You can always [register](http://mailman.science.ru.nl/mailman/listinfo/fieldtrip) again.
