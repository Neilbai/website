# Why was FieldTrip maintained in SVN and not in Git?

{% include markup/skyblue %}
This question does not apply any more.

We started using the [CVS](/development/cvs) version control system for FieldTrip development in 2004. In 2009 we switched to [Subversion](/development/svn), motivated by the SPM and EEGLAB teams also using it. Subsequently in 2016 we switched to [git and GitHub](/development/git) to facilitate external contributions.

Please see our [git and GitHub](/development/git) tutorial for more details.
