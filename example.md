Here you can find example MATLAB scripts together with documentation that show specific analyses done in FieldTrip or in MATLAB. The documentation here is often not as elaborate as the [tutorials](/tutorial), but goes more in detail into specific aspects of the data, code or analysis.

We invite you to [add your own](/development/contribute) tutorials to the website, considering the [documentation guidelines](/development/guideline/documentation). Whenever you explain somebody in person or over email how to do something with FieldTrip, please consider whether you could use the website for this, allowing others to learn from it as well.

See also the [tutorials](/tutorial) and [frequently asked questions](/faq).
