Today we discussed how to improve WARNINGs appearing on screen.

There are 5 different ways of giving information to users about the running of a code

- silent: It is not communicated what happens
- print: Notifications are printed on screen. E.g.: "processing trials"
- warning once: A warning printed on the screen when it occurs first.
- warning: A warning printed on screen. E.g.: "Warning: no baseline correction"
- error: Error printed on screen and the process is terminated.

We agreed today about the following:

- we should use warning and error **identifiers**.
- We would also like to give more information about the warnings. As a general guideline, when a warning is implemented, there should also be a **frequently asked question** created which explains why the warning has been implemented. The warning identifiers could help the user to find the relevant FAQ. The FAQ should also have a 'warning' tag.
- By using identifiers, warnings can be switched off automatically in Matlab. Hence, 'warning once' will be not necessary.

## Follow up

See https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tag/warning?do=showtag&tag=warning for pages with the **warning** tag.
