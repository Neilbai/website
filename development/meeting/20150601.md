## Agenda

- Robert and Jan-Mathijs will both be present

- discuss whether any of us can go to Melbourne

- usage tracking

## Minutes

- regarding Melbourne: nobody from Nijmegen is able to go. Ask Marcel or consider Vladimir or Mark.

- regarding tracking (at dccn): ip address, operating system, MATLAB version, PI group, user (anonymous), which functions are called, which functions give errors, which FieldTrip version. Possibly track it at the end of a MATLAB session, or only after N calls to a function (rather than on every function call), or only infrequently (i.e. store it persistently and send occasionally). TODO: start small, only one user, then whole DCCN, then scale up.
