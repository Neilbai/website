- <http://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2090> (Robert)

## Minutes

- discussed: interactive steps in the tutorials may benefit from video/gifs explaining more clearly what the user is supposed to be doing/seeing. People often get stuck here. Also, consider introducing some expected dwell-time in these sections.
