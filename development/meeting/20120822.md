- We will make **minutes** and put it on the FieldTrip wiki. Lilla undertook to make notes.

- **Dashboard**: An email will be send around weekly with a summary of failed test-scripts (test scripts are all functions beginning with test\_...) (assigned to Boris). Elke can make the Dashboard sortable to provide a better overview of the test functions. When someone starts to work on the test-scripts, the bugzilla should be used as in the case of any other bugs (the bug can be re-opened and assigned again or a new bug can be created).

- **closing resolved bugs**: Originally, the person who reported the bug is supposed to close the bug, but this does not often happen. Therefore, the person who fixed the bug can also close it.

- We discussed **bug1663** and **bug1318**.

- We also discussed (related to bug1318) that in the future, the **intermediate level of preprocessing** should be deprecated (see **bug1668**).
