- welcome Laura who is visiting in the framework of the Human Connectome project
- bug1064 (ft_preproc_derivative) is discussed
- we discussed segmentation (make more explicit: binary is special case of probabilistic) and parcellation
- fixing dashboard: still work in progress
- bug1637 is fixed: channel order can be sometimes random, we have to keep this in mind
- check all functions which use channel labels? Instead: create testscripts testing channel-order with different orderings, selections and with multiple inputs (related bug1707)
- for next week: one bug fix on the list, one on the dashboard. If a bug is not failing but it is reported as failing on dashboard, report it on bug1264
