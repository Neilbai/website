title: Ensure consistent units throughout fieldtrip
---

{% include /shared/development/warning.md %}


Goal: to consistently deal with spatial units.

Plan: investigate at which locations knowledge about the units is assumed/needed/appended to the data. at some places there could be even hard coded conversions. Build in explicit check-and-error, or correction when two objects are combined with different units.

1.  gradiometer/sensor definition
2.  volume-conductor specification
3.  grid computation

7.  leadfield computation e.g., meg_ini
8.  mri related functions: transformation matrix!
9.  sourceinterpolate
