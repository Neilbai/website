title: FieldTrip workshop at Washington University, St Louis
---

The workshop consisted of lectures and hands-on sessions. The lectures were broadcasted using WebEx and recorded. The recordings have been made available [online on the HCP site](http://www.humanconnectome.org/documentation/tutorials/field-trip-training.html). Regretfully they have rather poor audio; it was recorded with the speakerphone hanging on the wall, not with a proper microphone.

Another presentation that is available online is the FieldTrip lecture series at [BRAMS](http://brams.org) (International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research). These lectures were presented and recorded by Julian Keil, an enthousiastic user in Montreal. See <http://vimeo.com/user11934546/videos>.
