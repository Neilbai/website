## 6 Fitting EEG/MEG activity with dipole models

This document contains the MATLAB exercises that form part of the course “Neuroimaging
II” relating to dipole modeling, or dipole fitting.

The best way to approach the exercises is to create a MATLAB-script that can
be used to copy-and-paste the MATLAB-code in the instructions, and allows you
to play around with various parameter settings etc. You can open a new script
in the MATLAB-editor by typing edit on the command line, or by going to File->New->Script.
Next, you can save each script as a separate file in your course folder.

    ft_version

_These exercises treat the topic of dipole modeling. This technique is a so-called
parametric inverse method, because we will estimate a set of parameters yielding
a model of the observed data, which is aimed at explaining the data in an optimal
way. The modeling assumption we make here is that the spatial distribution of
measured potential or magnetic field at any moment in time is 'caused’ by a
limited number of equivalent current dipoles (ECDs). In the past sessions you
have learnt that we can build models of the potential difference or magnetic
field distribution for a given set of dipole parameters (3 location, and 3 moment
parameters). This is the so-called forward model. The idea of dipole modeling
is as follows: given a set of parameters we build a forward model of the data,
and compare this forward model with the measured data, by computing a measure
of goodness-of-fit. Then, we manipulate the parameters a tiny bit, recompute
the forward model, and see whether the goodness-of-fit is improved. If the goodness-of-fit
is improved, then the current model of the data apparently is better than the
previous one. We continue changing the parameters until we cannot further improve
the goodness-of-fit._

### 6.1 Fitting a model to the observed data

The first thing we need to do is to determine which data matrix we are going
to model. As you know by now, the measured data can be represented in a spatio-temporal
matrix, where the rows represent the channels, and the columns represent the
spatial topography of the observed activity for a given time point. We will
start by modeling the data that is observed at a single time point. Then, we
need to make an assumption about the number of dipoles (and thus the number
of parameters) that we believe underly the observed data. Here, we start with
assuming that the data can be modelled with just a single dipole.

After doing these exercises

- You understand how the observed data can be fitted to a model.
- You understand how to quantify the goodness-of-fit

We begin by generating some sensor-level data, by now this hopefully starts
to look familiar:

    [data, time] = ni2_activation;
    sensors = ni2_sensors('type', 'eeg');
    headmodel = ni2_headmodel('type', 'spherical', 'nshell', 3);
    leadfield = ni2_leadfield(sensors, headmodel, [4.9 0 6.2 0 1 0]);
    sensordata = leadfield * data + randn(91, 1000)*1e-3;

We have added some noise to the data, in order to make it look more realistic.

    figure; plot(time, sensordata);

Now we select a single time slice from the data matrix, which will serve as
our observed topography:

    topo_observed = sensordata(:, 500);
    figure; ni2_topoplot(sensors, topo_observed);

**_Q6.1.1 - Describe where in the scalp topography the dipolar pattern is visible._**

The standard-error-of-mean (SEM) or noise in the average scales inversely
proportional to the square root of the number of trials. So with 10 times more
trials, the noise is a factor sqrt(10) smaller, which is about 3x.

**_Q6.1.2 - Repeat the process with 3x times as little noise and make a figure.
This corresponds to 10x more trials._**

**_Q6.1.3 - Repeat the process with 3x times as much noise and make a figure.
This corresponds to 10x fewer trials._**

What is typically done in dipole fitting is that the model of the observed
data is created in a two-step procedure. First, given a set of location parameters,
the forward model is created, yielding an Nchannels x (Ndipoles x 3) leadfield
matrix, where each triplet of columns in the leadfield matrix represents the
topography of a unit-amplitude dipole at a given location, with an orientation
along one of the axes of the coordinate system. In a second step, the parameters
that describe the dipole(s’) moment are estimated using linear estimation. This
can be seen as a linear regression problem, where the leadfield matrix is the
'design matrix’, and the observed topography is the dependent variable.

In MATLAB this can be done in the following way. We assume a dipole at an
arbitrary location and first model the leadfield.

    leadfield = ni2_leadfield(sensors, headmodel, [5 5 4]);

Next, we are going to estimate the remainder of the parameters, i.e., the
3 dipole moment parameters, using linear estimation/least-squares regression.
In MATLAB this can be easily done using the `\` or backslash operator.

since we have

    topo_opserved = leadfield * dipmom + noise

By ignoring the noise we get

    topo_opserved = leadfield * dipmom

or by flipping left and right side

    leadfield * dipmom = topo_opserved

We can (conceptually) divide both sides by the leadfield to solve for dipmom.
However, since we are not working with scalars but with matrices, the division
is not simply a scalar division.

**_Q6.1.4 - Look up the help for the / (slash) and the \ (backslash) operator
by typing "doc /" and "doc \"._**

We can compute the least-squares optimal solution for dipmom using

    dipmom = leadfield \ topo_observed;

The modelled data can now easily be obtained by multiplying the leadfield
with the estimated dipole moment.

    topo_modelled = leadfield * dipmom;

**_Q6.1.5 - Plot the topography of the modelled dipole and compare it to the
previously plotted observed topography. Describe the difference._**

Now we can quantify the difference between the observed and modelled data,
by summing the squared differences, and relating this number to the sum of the
squared data values. The smaller this number, the better the fit.

    topo_residual = topo_observed-topo_modelled;
    sumsq = sum(topo_residual.^2) ./ sum(topo_observed.^2);

The value we have obtained for sumsq does not yet mean that much, unless it
is compared to the sumsq obtained for a fitted model with different parameters,
i.e., a dipole at another location.

**_Q6.1.6 - Make a scatter plot of the values in topo_modelled (along x) and
topo_observed (along y)._**

**_Q6.1.7 - Compare the sumsq value to the correlation that you can observe
(and compute) between the topo_modelled and topo_observed._**

### 6.2 Finding the optimal model

Now we know how to model the observed data using the leadfields created for
one or more dipoles with a prespecified location, and we know how to quantify
the goodness-of-fit between the modelled and observed data. Next, we need to
consider the strategies that can be used to find the optimal model. Since the
leadfields are non-linear functions of the parameters, there is no easy analytic
solution to this problem. Therefore, the implicit strategy is to sample the
parameter space, and to quantify for each setting of the parameters the goodness-of-fit.
The parameter settings yielding the best model fit are selected. Typically,
it does not make sense to just start placing dipoles at random locations and
to hope that you will find the model with the best overall fit (out of all possible
models. Particularly, when more than one dipole is assumed, the number of potential
combinations of locations quickly explodes, and becomes unmanageable. However,
in the single dipole case this seems to be a reasonable strategy. Under the
assumption that the error landscape (i.e., 1 – goodness-of-fit expressed as
a function of dipole location) is relatively smooth, one can sample the total
set of possible source locations on a 3-dimensional grid of equally spaced dipole
locations, and select the location that yields the smallest error. From this
location, one could start a non-linear search to find a final solution.

After these exercises

- You will understand the concept of the error function
- You will understand the concept of a grid search

To create an error function, one simply needs to repeat multiple times the
model fitting described in the previous section. One sensible strategy is to
create a regular 3-dimensional grid of dipole positions that can be used to
sample the parameter space. Here we do this with the following function call:

    sourcemodel = ni2_sourcemodel('type', 'grid', 'headmodel', headmodel, 'resolution', 1);

As a little aside, this creates a variable in MATLAB that is a so-called structure,
which is a special type of variable that is convenient when working with data
objects that have multiple attributes, i.e., features that belong together.
These features are stored in so-called fields, which contain the actual data.
In this example, if you type `sourcemodel` on the command line, you will see:

    sourcemodel =
        pos: [3610x3 double]
        inside: [3610x1 logical]
        dim: [19 19 10]

which means that the structure called `sourcemodel` has 4 fields, called `pos`,
`inside`, `outside`, and `dim`. The most relevant field is the pos-field which
contains a matrix with the positions defined in 3D-space. Note, that the number
of positions is 3610, which equals the product of the elements in the dim-field.
The dim-field defines the number of dipoles in each of the three directions
of the 3D-box that defines the search space. The inside and outside fields are
vectors which index which of the dipole positions are within the volume conduction
model, and which ones are outside it. Note, that the total number of elements
in the inside and outside fields matches the total number of positions. FieldTrip
makes extensive use of MATLAB-structures, so it is good to have some basic understanding
of this type of variable.

For illustration purposes we will first look at a subset of all positions
in this 3D-grid, and select those positions which have a z-coordinate of 6.
In other words, we are selecting those points that are on a plane that goes
almost through the location where we actually simulated the activity (we are
cheating a bit here, because usually we don’t know this of course).

    pos = sourcemodel.pos(sourcemodel.inside,:);
    sel = find(pos(:, 3)==6);
    pos = pos(sel,:);

**_Q6.2.1 - How many source positions do we have remaining after selecting
only the posiitons inside the head, and only for this slice?_**

Now, what we can do is repeat the steps in the previous section for each of
these points, i.e., we will model for each of the positions a dipole that optimally
explains the observed topography and compute a measure of goodness-of-fit. We
store these goodness-of-fit measures in a vector, so that we later can determine
which position gave the best fit. Doing the same time multiple times can be
easily solved with a for-loop.

    sumsq = zeros(size(pos, 1), 1);

    for k=1:size(pos, 1)
      disp(k)
      leadfield = ni2_leadfield(sensors, headmodel, pos(k,:));
      dipmom = leadfield \ topo_observed;
      topo_modelled = leadfield * dipmom;
      topo_residual = topo_observed-topo_modelled;
      sumsq(k) = sum(topo_residual.^2) ./ sum(topo_observed.^2);
    end

Now we have a variable sumsq that is a vector, rather than a single number.
We can visualize this variable using the `plot` function.

**_Q6.2.2 - Plot the sumsq values (along the y-axis) versus the index of the
dipole (along the x-axis)._**

We can now look for the position that yields the lowest sum of squared difference
values, i.e., the one with the best model fit. We could achieve this by zooming
in into the figure and writing down the x-coordinate where the sumsq-variable
seems to have the lowest value, but we can also use MATLAB’s min function:

    [m, ix] = min(sumsq)
    pos(ix,:)

Depending on the noise in the data, this position will be more or less close
to the actual simulated location.

One can improve on this estimate by fitting a model to more than one time
point. The idea is that the influence of noise on the single time point observed
topographies is attenuated when combining across time points. Assuming a fixed
dipole location, this extended temporal model is quite straightforward, we will
return to this later.

First, for convenience, we will repeat the steps above by using a set of pre-computed
leadfields, that we compute for the *full 3D grid*. Since the computation of
the leadfields is relatively expensive (time-consuming) in terms of computation,
it makes sense to compute them only once when they will be used multiple times.
Further down in this tutorial we will explore the effect of model assumptions
on the outcome, and do this using the grid search, so it pays off to compute
the leadfields.

    if false
      pos = sourcemodel.pos(sourcemodel.inside,:);
      leadfield = ni2_leadfield(sensors, headmodel, pos);
    else
      load leadfields
    end

    whos leadfield pos

Now we can very quickly compute the goodness-of-fit for all locations in the
3D grid:

    sumsq = ones(size(pos, 1), 1);

    for k=1:size(pos, 1)
      disp(k)
      ik = (k-1)*3+(1:3); % select the three columns corresponding to one position
      dipmom = leadfield(:, ik) \ topo_observed;
      topo_modelled = leadfield(:, ik) * dipmom;
      topo_residual = topo_observed-topo_modelled;
      sumsq(k) = sum(topo_residual.^2) ./ sum(topo_observed(:).^2);
    end

### 6.3 Adding the time dimension

When using the topography from a single time point for dipole modeling, noise
in the data can negatively affect the result. To this end it makes sense to
combine data across time points. Under the assumption that the model is stationary
in terms of dipole location (and possibly also in terms of orientation), pooling
across time points can be efficient in improving the model fit.

After these exercises:

- You will appreciate the fact that including temporal information can improve
the dipole fit.

For this exercise we will the simulated data that was generated in section
2. If you are not working through these exercises in a single session, please
go back to section 2, and re-create the variable sensordata.

Previously, we have used time point '500’ for the extraction of the observed
topography.

Yet, in our very simple generative model (with generative model we mean the
model that actually underlies the simulated data) there is only one dipole with
a fixed location and orientation. In other words, and this is something that
was highlighted in a previous session, there is essentially only a single topography
present in the data, which only varies as a function of time. Thus, in principle,
using time point '499’ should yield the same result as using time point '501’,
or, for that matter, any other time point. Obviously, since the strength of
the activity varies over time, some time points are more informative than others.

Now we are going to fit a single dipole model to a spatial topography from
a single time point, just as in the previous section. To speed things up, we
will not compute the leadfields on the fly, but load the pre-computed leadfields.

    topo_observed = sensordata(:, 500); % select one timeslice

    pos = sourcemodel.pos(sourcemodel.inside,:);
    load('leadfields');

    sumsq = ones(size(pos, 1), 1);
    for k=1:size(pos, 1)
      disp(k)
      ik=(k-1)*3+(1:3);
      dipmom = leadfield(:, ik) \ topo_observed;
      topo_modelled = leadfield(:, ik) * dipmom;
      topo_residual = topo_observed-topo_modelled;
      sumsq(k) = sum(topo_residual(:).^2)./sum(topo_observed(:).^2);
    end
    [m, ix] = min(sumsq)
    pos(ix,:)

Note the use of `topo_residual(:)` in the line of code just before the end
statement. This `(:)` instruction tells MATLAB to reshape a matrix into a vector.
This is not needed in case the topography consists of just a single time point
(because the observed topography is already a vector), but we will need it when
fitting multiple time points.

**_Q6.3.1 - Repeat the computation with topo_observed corresponding to all
sensordata, i.e., not selecting the 500th column but taking the whole matrix._**

**_Q6.3.2 - What is the size of the topo_residual variable?_**

**_Q6.3.3 - What is the size of the sumsq variable? Explain this._**

### 6.4 The real deal

So far, for didactical purposes, we have constrained ourselves and evaluated
the error-function based on a grid search. In this section we are going to use
one of FieldTrip’s core functions `ft_dipolefitting` to do a proper dipole fit
on our simulated EEG-data.

After this section

- You understand that the non-linear search for optimal dipole parameters
can yield a solution very close to the ground truth.

We start again by ensuring that we have the following variables in the MATLAB-workspace:
sensordata, headmodel and sensors. If you don’t have these variables available,
please go back to section 2 and create these variables.

Next, we need to create some variables that are recognized by FieldTrip. Most
FieldTrip functions work by providing 2 input arguments, a cfg-structure that
contains parameters that determine the behaviour of the function, and one (or
more) data-structures providing the data on which the function operates.

Let’s first create the data variable:

    data = [];
    data.avg = sensordata;
    data.time = time;
    data.label = sensors.label;
    data.elec = sensors;
    data.dimord = 'chan_time';

And the cfg-structure:

    cfg = [];
    cfg.gridsearch = 'yes';
    cfg.model = 'regional';
    cfg.headmodel = headmodel;
    cfg.latency = [0.49 0.51];
    cfg.nonlinear = 'yes';
    cfg.numdipoles = 1;

Now we can call the function:

    dip = ft_dipolefitting(cfg, data);

The output variable to `ft_dipolefitting` has a field `dip` containing information
about the optimal model. In particular, have a look at `dip.dip.pos`, and `dip.dip.mom`.
We can also visualize the modelled topography, and compare this to the observed
topography. These are represented in `dip.Vmodel` and `dip.Vdata`, respectively.

**_Q6.4.1 - Using the output of ft_dipolefitting, plot a topography of the
observed data at 500ms, plot a topography of the model data at 500ms, and plot
the topopgraphy of the residual._**

### 6.5 It’s all about the assumptions

One important issue in dipole modeling is that the prior assumptions critically
constrain the final model (and thus the model fit). If these assumptions don’t
coincide with what’s actually in the data, this can lead to erroneous interpretations.
This can work against you in two directions, either your model is too simplistic
(i.e., you assume too few dipoles), or too complicated (you assume too many
dipoles).

After these exercises:

- You understand that if your model assumptions violate the underlying data,
the results are suboptimal.

First, we create some sensor-level data that contains two sources:

    sensors = ni2_sensors('type', 'eeg');
    headmodel = ni2_headmodel('type', 'spherical', 'nshell', 3);

    [data1, time] = ni2_activation;
    [data2, time] = ni2_activation('frequency', 11, 'latency', 0.48);

    leadfield1 = ni2_leadfield(sensors, headmodel, [4.9 0 6.2 0 1 0]);
    leadfield2 = ni2_leadfield(sensors, headmodel, [-5.3 0 5.9 1 0 0]);
    sensordata = leadfield1*data1 + leadfield2*data2;

**_Q6.5.1 - Plot the EEG data versus time (along the x-axis) and observe the
alternating pattern._**

**_Q6.5.2 - Use the `ni2_topomovie` function to explore the alternating pattern
of activity._**

Let's add some noise

    sensordata = leadfield1*data1 + leadfield2*data2 + randn(91, 1000)*.7e-3;

Now we will perform the same grid search as in section 4, using the 490th
time point for the observed topography:

    topo_observed = sensordata(:, 490);

    sourcemodel = ni2_sourcemodel('type', 'grid', 'resolution', 1);
    pos = sourcemodel.pos(sourcemodel.inside,:);
    load('leadfields');

    sumsq = ones(size(pos, 1), 1);
    for k=1:size(pos, 1)
      disp(k)
      ik=(k-1)*3+(1:3);
      dipmom = leadfield(:, ik) \ topo_observed;
      topo_modelled = leadfield(:, ik)*dipmom;
      sumsq(k)= sum((topo_observed(:)-topo_modelled(:)).^2) ./ sum(topo_observed(:).^2);
    end

Now we are going to use the FieldTrip `ft_dipolefitting` function to fit a
single dipole:

    data = [];
    data.avg = sensordata;
    data.time = time;
    data.label = sensors.label;
    data.elec = sensors;
    data.dimord = 'chan_time';

    cfg = [];
    cfg.gridsearch = 'no';
    cfg.model = 'regional';
    cfg.headmodel = headmodel;
    cfg.latency = [0.49 0.51];
    cfg.nonlinear = 'yes';
    cfg.numdipoles = 1;
    dip = ft_dipolefitting(cfg, data);

**_Q6.5.3 - Where did the fitted dipole end up and how does that compare to
the initial poisition of dipole 1 and dipole 2?_**

We can also fit a model with two dipoles, this can be easily achieved by changing
the `cfg.numdipoles` option into 2.

    cfg = [];
    cfg.gridsearch = 'no';
    cfg.model = 'regional';
    cfg.headmodel = headmodel;
    cfg.latency = [0.49 0.51];
    cfg.nonlinear = 'yes';
    cfg.numdipoles = 2;
    dip = ft_dipolefitting(cfg, data);

As you may have noticed, the result is not particularly accurate. The reason
for this is that the optimization algorithm got trapped in a local minimum of
the error function. This is more likely to happen, the more complicated the
underlying model (i.e., more free parameters lead to a high-dimensional error
function with a complicated structure and potentially many local minima). We
can however inform the fitting algorithm with dipole positions from which to
start the non-linear search. If these starting positions are sufficiently close
to the actual source positions, the algorithm will converge to the correct solution.

    cfg = [];
    cfg.gridsearch = 'no';
    cfg.model = 'regional';
    cfg.headmodel = headmodel;
    cfg.latency = [0.49 0.51];
    cfg.nonlinear = 'yes';
    cfg.numdipoles = 2;
    cfg.dip.pos = [5 0 5; -5 0 5]; % starting positions
    dip = ft_dipolefitting(cfg, data);

**_Q6.5.4 - Repeat the dipole fit with two dipoles with their initial positions
for the whole tine interval from 0 to 1000 ms. Plot the residual variance (dip.dip.rv)
versus time and describe what you see._**
