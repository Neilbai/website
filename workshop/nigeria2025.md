# African Brain Data Network workshop in Nigeria

Together with the [African Brain Data Network](https://africanbraindatanetwork.com) we are organizing an intensive one-week EEG Workshop in Nigeria (9-14 June, 2025) designed to empower researchers across Africa with hands-on training and foundational knowledge in Electroencephalography (EEG). EEG is a powerful, non-invasive tool for studying brain activity and advancing neurotechnological research.

This workshop aims to:

- Provide foundational knowledge about EEG technology and applications.
- Offer hands-on training in experimental design, EEG data collection, processing, and analysis.
- Facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers across Africa.
- Discuss the relevance of EEG research in addressing African health and societal challenges.

During this workshop, you will get:

- Expert-led lectures on EEG principles, signal processing, and analysis.
- Practical sessions on EEG equipment setup and data acquisition.
- Hands-on training in data analysis using popular tools and platforms.
- Networking opportunities with leading researchers and peers.
- Discussions on ethics, contextualization of neurotechnological research in Africa.

Participants will bring a laptop with a recent web browser for the hands-on data analysis sessions. We will provide WiFi and the analysis will be done using online and open-source tools, so you don’t need special software on your laptop.

## Company support

We would like to thank [TMSi, an Artinis company](https://www.tmsi.artinis.com/), for borrowing us an 64-channel [SAGA](https://www.tmsi.artinis.com/saga) EEG system for the practical hands-on sessions.

## Registration

Since it is a workshop with a hands-on format, we have a limited number of seats available. Pre-registration is now closed and we will make a selection of interested candidates with the aim to maximize the impact of the training.

## Practicalities

See the [African Brain Data Network](https://africanbraindatanetwork.com/) homepage for up to date information. If you have any queries please contact <africanbraindatanetwork@gmail.com>.

### Who

It is organized by Damian Eke, Eberechi Wogu, Victor Owoyele, Ore Ogundipe, Robert Oostenveld, Mikkel C. Vinding, and various others help with the organization.

The lectures and hands-on sessions will be presented by [Robert Oostenveld](https://www.ru.nl/personen/oostenveld-r) from Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and [Mikkel C.

## Program

Day-by-Day Overview:

### Monday – Introduction & EEG Basics

The week begins with orientation and practical information, followed by foundational topics: what EEG is, its advantages over other neuroimaging techniques, and its applications in clinical, developmental, and cognitive research. Special emphasis is placed on African-specific challenges, such as dealing with natural hairstyles and electrode types. Sessions also experimental design and and stimulus control.

- registration and welcome
- introduction and format (lecture by Robert)
- background on EEG (lecture by Mikkel, 1st half)
- lunch
- background on EEG (lecture by Mikkel, 2nd half)
- EEG in Africa (lecture by Robert)
- experimental design part A (lecture by Mikkel)
- experimental design Q&A (discussion)

### Tuesday – Experimental Design & EEG Recording

EEG hardware, electrodes, caps and electrode placement is discussed. Hands-on sessions guide participants through installing stimulus software (e.g., [PsychoPy](https://psychopy.org/)), designing behavioral tasks, and handling hardware (e.g., EEG caps, electrodes, and cleaning). Participants split into groups to practice recording EEG, focusing on setup, troubleshooting, ethical handling, and documentation.

- how does an EEG system work (lecture by Robert, 1st half)
- recording of EEG (hands-on)
- lunch
- experimental design part B (lecture by Mikkel)
- designing a task and recording it ([hands-on](/workshop/nigeria2025/stimuli))

### Wednesday – EEG Data, Analysis Tools & Preprocessing

The precise timing of the experimental task and stimuli with the EEG is presented and demonstrated.Lectures cover EEG data formats, metadata (e.g., BIDS), and an overview of the FieldTrip toolbox and alternatives. Experimental design essentials, noise and typical artifacts, and the steps in preprocessing of EEG data such as filtering and rereferencing are presented, followed by practical exercises.

### Thursday – Event Related Potentials and Ethics

The rationale and analysis of event-related potentials (ERP) are presented, with applications to sensory and cognitive processes. The ERP difference wave is discussed, and participants do the preprocessing and compute ERPs in a task-based EEG dataset, contrasting visual and auditory conditions. Ethics, informed consent, incidental findings and adversial effects are presented, followed by a presentation and discussion on translating European practices to the African situation.

## How to prepare

### Installing FieldTrip and the data

Open MATLAB online and enter the following in the command window to download and unzip FieldTrip and the data. After that, you have to set up FieldTrip and change to the data directory.

    unzip('https://download.fieldtriptoolbox.org/workshop/nigeria2025/fieldtrip-20250517.zip')
    unzip('https://download.fieldtriptoolbox.org/workshop/nigeria2025/data.zip')

    addpath('/MATLAB Drive/fieldtrip-20250517')
    ft_defaults
    cd('/MATLAB Drive/data')

### Restarting MATLAB online

Whenever you restart MATLAB or when you are kicked out because of poor internet connectivity, you have to set up FieldTrip again.

    addpath('/MATLAB Drive/fieldtrip-20250517')
    ft_defaults
    cd('/MATLAB Drive/data')

It is important to save your edited m-files regularly, so that you can continue when you reconnect.
