# African Brain Data Network

Together with the African Brain Data Network we are organizing an intensive one-week EEG Workshop in Nigeria (9-14 June, 2025) designed to empower researchers across Africa with hands-on training and foundational knowledge in Electroencephalography (EEG). EEG is a powerful, non-invasive tool for studying brain activity and advancing neurotechnological research.

This workshop aims to:

- Provide foundational knowledge about EEG technology and applications.
- Offer hands-on training in experimental design, EEG data collection, processing, and analysis.
- Facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers across Africa.
- Discuss the relevance of EEG research in addressing African health and societal challenges.

During this workshop, you will get:

- Expert-led lectures on EEG principles, signal processing, and analysis.
- Practical sessions on EEG equipment setup and data acquisition.
- Hands-on training in data analysis using popular tools and platforms.
- Networking opportunities with leading researchers and peers.
- Discussions on ethics, contextualization of neurotechnological research in Africa.

Participants will bring a laptop with a recent web browser for the hands-on data analysis sessions. We will provide WiFi and the analysis will be done using online tools, so you don’t need special software on your laptop.

## Registration

Since it is a workshop with a hands-on format, we have a limited number of seats available. Pre-registration is now closed and we will make a selection of interested candidates with the aim to maximize the impact of the training.

## Practicalities

See the [African Brain Data Network](https://africanbraindatanetwork.com/) homepage for up to date information. If you have any queries please contact <africanbraindatanetwork@gmail.com>.

### Who

It is organized by Damian Eke, Eberechi Wogu, Victor Owoyele, Ore Ogundipe, Robert Oostenveld, Mikkel Vinding, and various others help with the organization.

The lectures and hands-on sessions will be presented by [Robert Oostenveld](https://www.ru.nl/personen/oostenveld-r) from Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and [Mikkel Vinding](https://psychology.ku.dk/staff/academic_staff/?pure=en/persons/805933) from Copenhagen University, Denmark. Both Robert and Mikkel have extensive experience with EEG, including designing the experiments, doing recordings, and analyzing data.

## Program

Day-by-Day Overview:

### Monday – Introduction & EEG Basics

The week begins with orientation and practical information, followed by foundational topics: what EEG is, its advantages over other neuroimaging techniques, and its applications in clinical, developmental, and cognitive research. Special emphasis is placed on African-specific challenges, such as dealing with natural hairstyles and electrode types. Sessions also address ethics, informed consent, and experimental design essentials, including noise, artifacts, attention, and stimulus control.

### Tuesday – Experimental Design & EEG Recording

Hands-on sessions guide participants through installing stimulus software (e.g., PsychoPy), designing behavioral tasks, and handling hardware (e.g., EEG caps, electrodes). Participants split into groups to practice recording EEG, focusing on setup, troubleshooting, ethical handling, and documentation.

### Wednesday – EEG Data & Analysis Tools

Lectures cover EEG data formats, metadata (e.g., BIDS), and an overview of the FieldTrip toolbox and alternatives. A comparison of clinical vs. cognitive EEG applications is provided, along with an introduction to analyzing event-related potentials (ERP), followed by practical exercises.

### Thursday – Frequency & Time-Frequency Analysis

Participants explore frequency-based EEG analysis (e.g., eyes open vs. closed, group comparisons), and are introduced to time-frequency and connectivity analysis—highlighting both their promise and complexity. These topics include short lectures with hands-on practice.

### Friday – Statistical & Advanced Analyses

Topics include experimental design types, statistical approaches (e.g., mixed models, Bayesian methods), and multiple comparison correction. Advanced methods such as source reconstruction, BCI applications, and neurofeedback are discussed, with an emphasis on high-density EEG setups (32/64 channels).

### Saturday – Wrap-up & Additional Practice

The final day is flexible, used for review, additional practice, or wrapping up unfinished work. Reflections on the week’s learning and experiences conclude the course.
