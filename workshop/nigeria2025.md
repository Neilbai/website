# African Brain Data Science Academy

We are contributing to an African Brain Data Science Academy intensive one-week EEG Workshop in Nigeria (9-14 June, 2025) designed to empower researchers across Africa with hands-on training and foundational knowledge in Electroencephalography (EEG). EEG is a powerful, non-invasive tool for studying brain activity and advancing neurotechnological research.

This workshop aims to:

- Provide foundational knowledge about EEG technology and applications.
- Offer hands-on training in experimental design, EEG data collection, processing, and analysis.
- Facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers across Africa.
- Discuss the relevance of EEG research in addressing African health and societal challenges.

During this workshop, you will get:

- Expert-led lectures on EEG principles, signal processing, and analysis.
- Practical sessions on EEG equipment setup and data acquisition.
- Hands-on training in data analysis using popular tools and platforms.
- Networking opportunities with leading researchers and peers.
- Discussions on ethics, contextualization of neurotechnological research in Africa.

Participants will bring a laptop with a recent web browser for the hands-on data analysis sessions. We will provide WiFi and the analysis will be done using online tools, so you donâ€™t need special software on your laptop.

## Registration

We have a limited number of seats available. Pre-registration is now closed and we will make a selection of interested candidates with the aim to maximize the impact of the training.

## Practicalities

See the [African Brain Data Science Network](https://africanbraindatanetwork.com/) homepage for up to date information. If you have any queries please contact <africanbraindatanetwork@gmail.com>.

### Who

It is organized by Ore Ogundipe, Eberechi Wogu, Victor Owoyele, Robert Oostenveld, Mikkel Vinding, and various others help with the organization.

The lectures and hands-on sessions will be presented by [Robert Oostenveld](https://www.ru.nl/personen/oostenveld-r) from Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and [Mikkel Vinding](https://psychology.ku.dk/staff/academic_staff/?pure=en/persons/805933) from Kopenhagen University, Denmark. Both Robert and Mikkel have extensive experience with EEG, including designing the experiments, doing recordings, and analyzing data.
