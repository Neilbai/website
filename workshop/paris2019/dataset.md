The dataset that we analyze in these tutorials is part of a dataset recorded by Daniel Wakeman and Rik Henson. During the PracticalMEEG hands-on sessions we will mainly work with the MEG data of a single representative subject, for the group statistics we will work with source-level processed data from all subjects.
