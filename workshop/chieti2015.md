### When

September 18, 2015.

### Who

Laura Marzetti and Robert Oostenveld.

This workshop is an **advanced** workshop in which we will move beyond standard MEG data processing. Familiarity with FieldTrip is required. Please read the [FieldTrip](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2011/156869/) reference papers to understand the toolbox design.

To prepare for the hands-on session, you should watch the following online videos prior to the workshop. Note that these lectures are about one hour each, which means that you should **plan ahead and take your time** to go through them. It is your own responsibility to come well-prepared. Starting one day in advance will not cut it!
